  <h1>5-10-19 ihop</h1>
  <p>i ordered a strawberry banana pancake stack with french vanilla coffee</p>
  <p>the pancakes were meh, (and you might here that word often in this review) while they did taste good, cooking bananas into the cakes kind of ruined it, giving it a "meh" experience</p>
  <p>the coffee was surprisingly well made, then again you have to try pretty hard to mess up coffee, another overall average, meh, experience</p>
  
  <h1>5-12-19 ihop</h1>
  <p>i took my mom and brother to ihop for mothers day, it was an alright time</p>
  <p>My brother and i got the brunch burger while mom had a double blueberry stack</p>
  <p>My brother's quote is that the burger was "pretty good, i think i put too much pepper on the egg though"</p>
  <p>My mom had this to say about the double blueberry stack "it was super good, however it was too much for me to eat, good thing ihop has takeout boxes!"</p>
  <p>For my encounter, the eggs were a bit overcooked, and the hashbrowns were a bit too crispy, the patty makes up for it in flavor and heartiness</p>
